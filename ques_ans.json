  "Network Security": {
    "question": "How do you ensure the network is secure against unauthorized access and common vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "To mitigate risks, we enforce a layered security approach using firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), VPNs for secure remote access, and strong network segmentation. Regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing are conducted, and network traffic is monitored for anomalies. Compliance standards like NIST SP 800-53 and ISO 27001 require strict access controls and periodic monitoring to secure network infrastructure."
  },
  "Identity and Access Management (IAM)": {
    "question": "What strategies are in place for securing user identities and access permissions?",
    "answer": "We enforce strong, multi-factor authentication (MFA), least-privilege access principles, and periodic reviews of access rights. Privileged Access Management (PAM) is used for sensitive accounts, and single sign-on (SSO) is implemented where possible. Compliance with NIST 800-63B and ISO 27001 Annex A.9 ensures that authentication mechanisms and access controls are robust and secure."
  },
  "Incident Response": {
    "question": "What is your organizationâ€™s plan for responding to security incidents?",
    "answer": "Our incident response plan (IRP) includes preparation, detection, containment, eradication, and recovery steps. We have a dedicated incident response team (IRT) and use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools to detect and escalate incidents swiftly. We conduct regular drills and tabletop exercises as per ISO 27035 and NIST SP 800-61 guidelines to maintain readiness and regulatory compliance."
  },
  "Cloud Security": {
    "question": "How do you secure data and workloads in the cloud environment?",
    "answer": "We ensure that cloud services are configured securely, using encryption, access control lists (ACLs), and regular audits to mitigate misconfigurations. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit, and cloud vendor compliance (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27017/18) is verified. Compliance standards like CSA STAR and ISO 27001 Annex A.14 require secure configurations and controls for cloud environments."
  },
  "Endpoint Security": {
    "question": "How are endpoints like laptops, mobile devices, and IoT protected from cyber threats?",
    "answer": "We deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, enforce antivirus software, and require device encryption for data protection. Regular patches and updates are applied to reduce vulnerability risks. We also employ mobile device management (MDM) systems to control access to enterprise resources. Compliance standards such as CIS Controls and NIST SP 800-171 outline best practices for endpoint security."
  },
  "Data Security": {
    "question": "What measures are in place to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data?",
    "answer": "Data is classified based on sensitivity, and encryption is applied for both at-rest and in-transit data. Access controls limit data access based on the principle of least privilege. Regular backups and data masking/anonymization techniques protect sensitive data, as per GDPR requirements and ISO 27001 Annex A.8, which enforce data protection standards and regular data access reviews."
  },
  "Application Security": {
    "question": "How do you secure applications from potential vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "We conduct secure coding practices, static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST), and regular code reviews. Web application firewalls (WAF) protect against common threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). Standards like OWASP Top 10, PCI DSS for sensitive applications, and ISO 27034 (application security) help guide secure application development practices."
  },
  "Compliance and Governance": {
    "question": "What frameworks and compliance standards guide your security policies and controls?",
    "answer": "Our security framework follows ISO 27001, NIST, and relevant regional standards like GDPR and CCPA. We have established a governance structure that includes regular policy reviews, risk assessments, and compliance audits to ensure that all security controls align with industry standards and legal requirements. Adherence to these frameworks demonstrates compliance and commitment to data protection."
  },
  "Risk Management": {
    "question": "How do you identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks?",
    "answer": "We conduct regular risk assessments, classify assets by their risk level, and prioritize risk mitigation strategies accordingly. Risk registers are maintained to document and track identified risks, and we use frameworks like NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and ISO 31000 for structured risk handling. Regular reviews ensure risk controls stay effective and compliant with regulatory standards."
  },
  "Threat Intelligence": {
    "question": "How do you leverage threat intelligence to protect against evolving threats?",
    "answer": "We subscribe to reputable threat intelligence feeds and participate in information-sharing groups. Our SIEM and other monitoring tools integrate threat intelligence to proactively detect emerging threats. Standards like MITRE ATT&CK and ISO 27001 Annex A.12 guide our threat intelligence practices, ensuring our defenses are aligned with the latest threat landscape."
